# Bug Wars Game Engine
The Bug Wars Game Engine contains an Interpreter for the Bug Wars AI Script language.  During gameplay, the Game Engine manages the Program Counter for each bug, executes commands, and processes results.

## Order of Operations
1. Conditionals (up to a maximum of 6) otherwise a bug action is NOOP
2. EAT - Mark all eating actons
3. Conditionals
4. MOVEMENT
5. JUMP
6. ATTACK
7. RESOLVE Marked squares by generating new bugs from food.
